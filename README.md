Initialize the repository with a README file.
1.4 Make Your First Commit (5 minutes):

Edit the README file to include a brief description of the lab session.
Commit the changes directly to the main branch.
Part 2: Working with Jupyter Notebooks (35 minutes):

Note: Installing Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code on your computer is not mandatory. You can complete this assignment using online environments like Google Colab or AWS SageMaker Studio Lab, which have Jupyter built-in.

2.1 Accessing Jupyter Notebooks (10 minutes):

Choose one of the following options:

Option A: Use an Online Environment (Recommended for Beginners):

Google Colab:

Go to Google Colab.
Sign in with your Google account.
Click on "File" > "New Notebook" to create a new notebook.
AWS SageMaker Studio Lab:

Visit AWS SageMaker Studio Lab.
Sign up for a free account.
Once your account is set up, create a new notebook.
Option B: Install Jupyter Notebook Locally:

Follow the instructions in the separate Jupyter Tutorial presentation to install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab on your computer.
2.2 Launching Jupyter Notebook (5 minutes):

If using an online environment, your notebook is ready to use.
If installed locally, open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from your computer. Tip  If you have  VS  Code all you need to add the extension
Explore the interface to understand the layout (notebook dashboard, file list, kernels).
2.3 Create Your First Notebook (5 minutes):

Create a New Notebook:

In your chosen environment, create a new Jupyter Notebook.
Add a Markdown Cell:

Insert a new cell.
Change the cell type to "Markdown."
Write some Markdown text, e.g., "My first markdown cell in Jupyter."
Add a Code Cell:

Insert another new cell.
Ensure the cell type is "Code."
Write some Python code, e.g., print("Hello, World!").
Run the Cells:

Press Shift + Enter to execute each cell.
Observe the output below the code cell.
2.4 Saving and Sharing Your Notebook (5 minutes):

Save the Notebook:

In the online environment, click on "File" > "Save" or "Save a Copy in Drive" (for Google Colab).
If working locally, save the notebook file (.ipynb) on your computer.
Download the Notebook:

From the online environment, click on "File" > "Download" > "Download .ipynb".
Save the file to your computer.
Upload to GitHub:

Note: To upload your notebook to GitHub, you'll need to install GitHub Desktop on your computer.

Installing GitHub Desktop:

Download and install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.comLinks to an external site..
Sign in with your GitHub account within GitHub Desktop.
Using GitHub Desktop to Upload Your Notebook:

Clone Your Repository:

Open GitHub Desktop.
Click on "File" > "Clone Repository."
Select the "URL" tab.
Enter the URL of your repository (e.g., https://github.com/[YourUsername]/jupyter-exploration).
Choose a local path where you want to store the repository on your computer.
Click "Clone."
Add Your Notebook File:

Navigate to the local repository folder on your computer.
Copy your My_First_Notebook.ipynb file into this folder.
Commit and Push Changes:

Return to GitHub Desktop.
You should see your notebook file listed under "Changes."
Enter a commit message like "Add my first Jupyter Notebook."
Click "Commit to main."
Click "Push origin" to upload the changes to GitHub.
